Hello, I'm Purnima Kumar ðŸ˜€
I'm school-taught C++ Programmer & self-learning Front End Developer based in India. For now, I freelance and 
build projects for fun. I build websites with a focus on responsive design, accessbility and pleasing aesthetics.
I'm pursuing BSc (Hons) Computer Science from Delhi University.

I constantly try to learn new technologies and concepts but here are the things I can do right now:
HTML
CSS
C++
DBMS
JAVA
PYTHON
Read books
Drink much tea/coffee

More about me:
I first started coding sometime in 2017 when I took Computer Science in 11th standard in school. The very 
first language I learnt was C++ and from then, I was hooked. I knew I enjoyed figuring out the logic behind 
applications but recently I became more interested in learning how to make it pretty for the users.

I'm trying to achieve my beginner level developer status. I'm also looking for interships or freelance work under well guidance
to gain work experience.

Thank for reading ðŸ˜Š
